I don't know what caused the fact that we have two multiverse movies in theatres at the same time. Coincidentally both tell a story about a mother's relationship with her family. **Everything Everywhere All At Once** is my favourite though[^1]. It takes the multiverse concept to the next level, while it also tells a very human story. **Doctor Strange** is nice, albeit a bit more formulaic. Still one of the better Marvel movies. **Everything Everywhere** is super creative, crazy fun and comes highly recommended.

[^1]: If you watched and logged the movie, [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/film/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/) developers have been creative with some of those googly eyes.
