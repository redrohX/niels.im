2024 was my best year in running since I started doing runs more than ten years ago. This has also been the first year that I took running serious and made it into a habit that I really enjoyed. I really found the joy in running, using it to improve my physical and mental health.

In total I ran more than 1400 km, I joined my local Parkrun once every couple of weeks and I finished three official events: two half marathons (one street, one trail), and one ten mile event (Dam tot Dam loop).

I ran for about three or four times per week, every week. Even on my holiday this summer. I ran five times in Italy and once in France. What helped was doing some research beforehand and just bringing my gear. Running in Italy meant getting up early, before it was too hot.

My goals for this year is to continue this streak. Iâ€™m joining a running group to train for a faster half marathon and I will join at least another official half marathon event, on trail or road. Subgoals are to improve my endurance, faster pace, run longer distances and help my girlfriend train to run a 5k.
