I used **Logseq** at work today for my notes and todo's. I had some issues with iCloud syncing though. Not sure what happened, but at some point my daily journal note was set to September the 6th (06-09-2022) on macOS and empty for today (09-06-2022) on iOS. I guess somewhere down the line it used the US date notation, while I'm actually using the regular notation. Might be a simple beta issue on the Logseq side, but why does the US still use their own date notation, while the rest of the world doesn't? It's as silly and confusing as using feet and pints for measurements.
