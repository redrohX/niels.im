I'm kind of bummed out by the findings of privacy researcher Zach Edwards, who found out DuckDuckGo's 'privacy friendly' browsers whitelists trackers from advertising partner Microsoft. Sure, when something is free, you are the product. But that's usually scribbled somewhere in the privacy policy. This feels like DuckDuckGo pretty much lies about the privacy features of its products.
