Interesting article from [Bramus](https://www.bram.us) where he covers in detail the different ways to enable toggling dark/light modes, but also pleads for a native browser feature. I agree with him here. Most browsers already have this feature build into their devtools, enabling this in the regular UI should be relatively easy, right?
