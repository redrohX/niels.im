It took some effort, but I have [Indiekit](https://getindiekit.com/) in some basic form running on a VPS. Which makes it possible to publish posts with Micropub on my personal website and (optionally) syndicate these posts to Mastodon (and Twitter, but I don’t know anyone who is using this).

This is the first real post I’m writing with the Indiekit interface. Which is basically a very basic CMS, but because of the Micropub standards, makes it also possible to use different Micropub clients. I haven’t tried this yet, but it should make it easier to get into the behavior of publishing my (social media) posts to my own website first.
