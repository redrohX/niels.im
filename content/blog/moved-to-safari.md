Ever since Firefox solved their performance problems on macOS I've been an avid user of the browser. Since I usually try to avoid Google due to privacy concerns, I was happy to use Firefox the last few years. But ever since I tried Safari I noticed a very significant increase in battery life of My Macbook Pro. So much that I'm currently using Safari as my daily driver. A decision of which I have mixed feelings. I miss some of the Firefox functionality and also the excellent uBlock origin plugin. I also had to disable iCloud Private Relay in Safari, because pages didn't load or loaded very, very slowly (it actually took me quite a while to figure out what was causing this). Safari is integrated into the OS, so at least I can use Apple Pay now. Also Dashlane (my password manager) integration is better with their new Safari plugin.
