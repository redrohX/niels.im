It was 2021 and during the pandemic I started all sort of new obsessions. One of these was ripping my CD library to digital FLAC files and finally have all the music I personally own available for streaming in my Plex library with Plexamp.

Why would I do such a thing when most of my music collection is easily available on Spotify or Apple Music? Well, for once, this is not 'just' a collection, but my personal collection, music I've curated since my teens, up till my thirties. There is a history here, memories, parts of my life I associate with certain soundtracks. Hell, my late teens - early twenties was an important period where I basically formed my core music interests (like most cool people).

I can possibly tell you some trivial facts related to me or the music for about 80% of my collection. It's a huge part of me, so that's why I'm one of the few people who didn't get rid of their CD collection when I moved over to streaming (and kept supporting artists when I moved over to collecting vinyl). As a good memory, my CD's have always been following me around, bound to their Ikea shelves, wrapped in plastic while moving houses. Nowadays they sit behind my screen, while I look at them during working hours. I guess that's where the idea started to rip everything to FLAC files.

I didn't really play these CD's in years. I didn't even own a CD player until I recently got my old Sony player back from my parent's home. I've embraced playing digital music files for almost twenty years now. First as MP3's in iTunes that I shared with my Sonos streaming devices (early adopter) and later when I discovered Spotify (another early adopter). I partly ripped my own CD collection, tagged inconsistently, about 20 years ago and downloaded a lot of crappy quality MP3 files, without a care for any quality control. This time I wanted to keep the quality high, rip everything to FLAC, tag consistently and automate it (because I'm not going to typ everything manually).

So almost two years later I finally ripped the last CD in my collection. Together with everything I already collected (mostly from Bandcamp and/or digital download cards that came with vinyl) I have about 1TB of music on my NAS.

What did I use to rip my CD's? From CD to FLAC I used Exact Audio Copy. As far as I know this is still the best audio ripping software. It's not exactly fast, but accurate and at least it automatically recognizes CD's, so the meta data is usually correct.
