Usually I don't really care for country music, but Orville Peck recently surprised me with his new album Bronco. It's not your typical country. I hear rock, gothic and pop influences. The excellent songwriting is really the highlight here. Almost all of the songs are good to great. Catchy, layered with a clear production. This is album of the year material.
